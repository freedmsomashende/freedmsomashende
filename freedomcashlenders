Loan durations are too short, which leads to unaffordable payments and frequent reborrowing. 	Borrowers will have at least 3 months to repay a loan, or monthly payments on short-term loans will be limited to 6% of the borrower’s gross monthly income.
Loan durations are too long, which extends indebtedness and drives up the cost of borrowing.
Total loan costs will be limited to 60% of loan principal, which eliminates lenders’ incentive to set unreasonably long repayment terms.
Prices are far higher than necessary to ensure widely available credit.
Allows lenders to charge 28% interest plus a reasonable monthly maintenance fee. This is substantially lower than typical payday loan pricing but sustainable for efficient lenders, meaning credit will continue to flow.
Front-loaded charges make refinancing costly and prolong indebtedness.
Requires equal payments consisting of principal, interest, and fees combined, with strong protections against front-loaded fees.
